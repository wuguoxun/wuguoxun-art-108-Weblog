    <h3>The Furious Baby</h3>

    <p>The Furious Baby is a 2D platforming game with 5 levels. In this project, I take care of the artist's part for creating the assets of the game. For instance, in the background design, I made a serious of the gradual change color background,
      because it looks more simple and the player can emphasize the character. Also, it relaxes the eyes as well. For the game characters and objects, I created the main character which is the baby seat on the stroller, it comes with two parts and
      complete drawing and coloring by the illustrator. There are few objects we have which is a different type of saws, it's an obstacle for the game. So I create a crash sound for it. However, there also are background music, goal sound, and fail
      sounds as well. As an artist, I always focus on the aspect of aesthetics and also take care of the rule of the game. Unfortunately, we don't have any feedback from peers because we didn't release a playable Unity file due to I lost my
      programer. Therefore, we miss a lot of the experiences and feedback for future plans. Anyways, I still learned that the process of preparing the assets and correct all the size and format.
