    <h3>Super Tank</h3>
    <p>The game I play is called “Super Tank”, it’s so interesting and I play around about half an hour. During the game, I control a tank drive around, the mission is to get a higher point which is challenge and light up my passion as well.
      Survival and eat the “points” is the basic way to gain points. In the meantime, the commuter will send more and more tanks to attack me but I can shoot back and destroy them, also it gets points as well. But it really challenges my brain and
      hands. The main difference between playing on an emulator and playing the game on the original hardware is the feeling. I like the original hardware more because it draws me in when I tap the button. Also, the screen is too small for me to
      play in my browser. Anyways, there is one thing that makes me joyful when playing on the browser is I can crazy insert coins and has an unlimited life.</p>

    <h3>King of Tokyo</h3>
    <p>Players: Timothy To, Eric Moua, Jolene Tsai, Jacob Moreno, Wilson Wu, Yingshi Feng
    </p>
    <p>King of Tokyo is a simple game that fit any age. I have the opportunity to play it with Timothy To, Eric Moua, Jolene Tsai, Jacob Moreno, and Yingshi Feng. We have six players at the beginning and each of us picks out a character as well as
      put it in the respective board. The board has 3 random pick cards available to purchase. And the cards clearly explain what is it and how to use it. However, we start to roll the dies to determine who goes first. Eric goes first, he enters
      Tokyo bay and gets energy. Then Timothy got 3 energy and save it. I think saving energy is a smart move anyways. The following play Yingshi enters the Bay too. In my turn, I attack the people who enter the bay. They lose hearts. And I notice
      people who stay inside the bay have easier died. Because everybody is attacking them. In the second round, I attack the people in the bay again then he dies as well, but I have to move in the bay to fill the empty space. Then Yingshi attacks
      me 4 points. Eric uses the card call destroy to me and it loses my other 6 points at once. I died. Eric kills all the players in the bay and wins the game.</p>
