    <h3>Course Reflection</h3>
    <p>Participating in this class, I learned a lot of things about the game. Such as the principle of the game, what is the DMA of game design, and many others. I love game before I take this class, but I never think about those specific concepts.
      In the very beginning, I played the board game in the class, then I learned how the mechanic, game testing, and feedback affecting the game. And I study the video game later, it has the same rules as the board game and relates to each other.
      It taught me not only the process of creating a game but also thinking farter and deeper. In this part, I think the feedback of the player is extremely valuable, they always have some thought that I have not prepared, it helps me improve.
      However, during the prototype game test, my partner was lost. I don't have a chance to experience the feedback from the peer. But I still learned how to prepared the assets for the Unity game which is a great experience. In the final project,
      I become a programmer. At this time, we successfully publish the game on Itch.io and receive much useful feedback from peers. The game called "Angel and demon" that I made by HTML teach me so many things. I have to watch many tutorials during
      the different steps of the game function, such as how to create the game function, death, win, start over, move to the next scene, and many things else. Also, apply the assets and animate is another challenge, I am an artist but I improve my
      programming skill a lot this time. All the code in my game is created by my own step by step and didn't use any template or platform, because I think it can maximum my learning outcome. In the final presentation, many student choices to give a
      presentation and write an essay about some interesting topics. They did a lot of research to showing me a deeper knowledge of games, also game history. I appreciated it and feel more excited about the game design.</p>
