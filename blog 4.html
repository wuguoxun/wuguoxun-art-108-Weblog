    <h3>"This is the only level" and "Canabalt"</h3>
  <p>The game "This is the Only Level " is a brain challenge game that needs a strategy to pass. This is joyful to play because it always surprises me. The other game "Canabalt" has a similar method to pass the game. It needs strategy and brain as well, but the difference is it required players to have a lot more hand control and good Eye-hand flexibility. The most critical connection between "This is the Only Level " and "Canabalt" is that both of them challenge playersâ€™ multitasking capabilities. Such as in the "This is the Only Level ", I have to read the tips text and figure the rule out and control the elephant move. And the "Canabalt" is more difficult to control because it goes very fast. I need to think about the pass rules and move my finger as fast as I can. This feature makes these games quite tricky and challenging. However, both of these two games are aimed at level completed, and it should be replayed multiple times to pass it.</p>

  <h3>"A dance of fire and ice"</h3>
    <p>The third game that I play is called "A dance of fire and ice". This is the rhythm game that challenges the control and observation at the same time. When I watch my partner play. It looks very hard to follow the rhythm because my partner is always out of the beats and replay it many times. Also, the game goes more and more difficult when leveling up. Eventually, it rapidly increases speed in such a manner when I stand aside and observe the gameplay. When I play the game, I understand what is happening and it's different from observing the gameplay. It required player attention, so I can find out the strategy much sooner. However, it goes better when we play it for a while and understand the discipline. </p>
