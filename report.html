    <h3>Super Tank</h3>
    <p>The game I play is called “Super Tank”, it’s so interesting and I play around about half an hour. During the game, I control a tank drive around, the mission is to get a higher point which is challenge and light up my passion as well. Survival and eat the “points” is the basic way to gain points. In the meantime, the commuter will send more and more tanks to attack me but I can shoot back and destroy them, also it gets points as well. But it really challenges my brain and hands. The main difference between playing on an emulator and playing the game on the original hardware is the feeling. I like the original hardware more because it draws me in when I tap the button. Also, the screen is too small for me to play in my browser. Anyways, there is one thing that makes me joyful when playing on the browser is I can crazy insert coins and has an unlimited life.</p>
