    <h3>The Furious Baby</h3>
    <p>The FUrious Baby is a 2D platforming game with 5 levels. In this project, I take care of the artist's part for creating the assets of the game. For instance, the background design, the game characters, objects and scenes that all finished by
      Illustrator. Also, the music and sound for every single action. I always focus on the aspect of aesthetic and the rule of the game. However, we don't have any feedback from peers because we didn't release a playable Unity file due to we lost
      the programer. Therefore, we miss a lot of the experiences and feedback for future plans. Anyways, I still learned that the process of preparing the assets and correct all the size and format. Also, the experiences of file transit help well.</p>
