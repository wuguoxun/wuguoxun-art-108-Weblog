    <h3>Angel & Demon</h3>

    <p>
      In the final project, we have a group of two people: Yingshi Feng and Guoxun Wu. Since both of us are artists, we will put more attention to the design elements. Our game is called “Angel and Demon”, it is a video game that the player uses
      the arrow keys to move characters around the board, As the characters find huaman, it cures/kills the human, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the character either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The game is inspired by
      the classic snake game, it has the same basic function and mechanics that are able to remind the players of familiar control even without any guild. Also we will offer two-player mode, players can play this game on the same screen. The reason
      for making this mode is we believe two-player games can offer an incredible social experience for players. Being able to play with others can also increase the excitement and competition levels of a game. While you are faced with challenges,
      including quests and battles against other people. People will be a lot more excited and it’s the point how competitive games drop me in.

      The concept behind the game is influenced by the recent disaster COVID 19. The government requires people to have shelter in place policy. In this situation, we would like to offer a game that gives intimate experience to people between family
      or friends. And people also can spend their time more fun and go through this particular time easier. Thus, the theme of our game is defeating the virus. We create two main characters “Angel” and “Demon”, they control by the play one and two,
      the goal is chasing the human and infect/cure them as well.
      The background story will be presented as an animation in the start menu. In 2019, the demon creates an infectious disease and puts it in a bat's body. A farmer inadvertently ate the bat then the demon disease infected him immediately. But the
      disease is cunning, it doesn't have any symptoms when the farmer gets it. The farmer keeps working and handouts with his friends in the next couple of days. However, the demon disease spread out to anywhere in the world. Many people are dead
      and fear full of the world. The only way to defeat it is to unite and fight it together. Anyone can be a soldier in this disease battle. Select "Angel" or "Demon" to start the game and save our world.

      In this version, We add a few more features to the game. I created a “leave feedback input field” that allows visitors to write down their comments, it will real time updates and shows the comments on the screen. Also, I attached the
      small icon on the left top corner that linked to our game Twitter, it allows visitors to contact us and join the discussion of our game as well. I am keep working on coding and debugging. In the last peer review, they pointed out some bugs and
      improvement. However, now all the functional problems that occurred in the last version have been solved. For the aesthetic part, I loaded and applied all the assets provided by our artist Yingshi to our game, such as the fonts design, border
      image, characters design, sound effects and coloring. For the sound effects part, we build, eat sound, pause sound, start over sound, win sound and background music as well. I think all the sound and music are perfect match to our game theme.
      Artist did a great job here. Also we made some animated water effect buttons that provide an interesting experience to our players.
