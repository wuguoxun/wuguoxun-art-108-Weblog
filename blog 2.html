  <h3>King of Tokyo</h3>
  <p>Players: Timothy To, Eric Moua, Jolene Tsai, Jacob Moreno, Wilson Wu, Yingshi Feng
  </p>
  <p>King of Tokyo is a simple game that fit any age. I have the opportunity to play it with Timothy To, Eric Moua, Jolene Tsai, Jacob Moreno, and Yingshi Feng. We have six players at the beginning and each of us picks out a character as well as
    put it in the respective board. The board has 3 random pick cards available to purchase. And the cards clearly explain what is it and how to use it. However, we start to roll the dies to determine who goes first. Eric goes first, he enters
    Tokyo bay and gets energy. Then Timothy got 3 energy and save it. I think saving energy is a smart move anyways. The following play Yingshi enters the Bay too. In my turn, I attack the people who enter the bay. They lose hearts. And I notice
    people who stay inside the bay have easier died. Because everybody is attacking them. In the second round, I attack the people in the bay again then he dies as well, but I have to move in the bay to fill the empty space. Then Yingshi attacks
    me 4 points. Eric uses the card call destroy to me and it loses my other 6 points at once. I died. Eric kills all the players in the bay and wins the game.</p>
